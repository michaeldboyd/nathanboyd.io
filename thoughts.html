                Nathan, I've learned so much from books about great entrepreneurs. 
                To inspire you, I've sent you Elon Musk's biography. 
                I'd encourage you to read it, and think about how you can emulate Elon's entrepeneurial spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have found that writing is really helpful when I'm learning something new. 
                As you read Elon Musk's biography, take notes. When you are done, I'd recommend that you write an article on your website describing what you've learned. 
                This will help you remember what you've learned, but will also help you in another way.
            </p>
